# Melo UI: User-Interface for Melo

## Overview

This user interface is a web based interface using HTML5, CSS and javascript to
makes it cross-platform.

On CSS side, the **Bootstrap v4** framework is used as foundation since it
provides all necessary components and utilities to make a responsive user
interface easily, and a large community is behind. For Melo UI, we use the SCSS
version of **Bootstrap** in order to embed only useful components and to use the
mixins for Melo SCSS modules.

## Build

To generate all CSS and Javascript files, the script **build.sh** can be called:
it will do all stuff automatically for you (on condition that environment has
been set up correctly, see section above for more details).

```sh
./build.sh
```
